Additional analyses of coronavirus in Sewage in New Haven for Peccia et al

These are additional analyses of data examining increases in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sewage sludge in 
relation to COVID-19 hospitalizations and cases. The original preprint, led by Jordan Peccia, et al can be found here:

The original pre-print included a correlation of smoothed versions of the viral RNA data 
and the epidemiological indicators. In the analyses presented here, we use an error-in-variables 
time series model to get an estimate of the underlying viral dynamics in sewage and the relationship of this with hospitalizations. 
This analysis is carried out in the Bayesian framework, allowing us to correctly quantify uncertainty in the estimated associations. 
These additional analyses were performed by Dan Weinberger (Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health),
with input from Josh Warren (Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health) and the rest of the original study team.
